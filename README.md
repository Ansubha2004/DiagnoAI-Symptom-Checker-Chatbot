# [DiagnoAI:- SymptomChecker Chatbot](https://diagnoaichatbot.netlify.app/)



**Diagno AI** is an intelligent, web-based AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users in understanding their symptoms and receiving preliminary health guidance. By leveraging the power of **Gemini 2.0 Flash API**, which is specifically tuned for healthcare and medical applications, the chatbot can analyze user-reported symptoms and provide insightful, data-driven recommendations.

This application is built with modern web technologies, including **React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js**, ensuring high performance, seamless navigation, and optimal responsiveness across different devices. The chatbot interface is further enhanced with React Icons for intuitive visual elements and AOS (Animation on Scroll) to provide a smooth, engaging user experience.

With a user-friendly and visually appealing UI/UX designed in Figma, Diagno AI prioritizes accessibility, ensuring that users can interact with the chatbot effortlessly. Whether users seek basic health insights, potential causes of their symptoms, or guidance on the next steps, the chatbot offers clear, concise, and reassuring responses. However, it explicitly states that it is not a substitute for professional medical consultation and encourages users to seek medical attention when necessary.

By integrating cutting-edge AI with a well-structured, interactive interface, Diagno AI aims to enhance accessibility to preliminary healthcare support, offering users a valuable tool for symptom assessment anytime, anywhere. üöÄ
